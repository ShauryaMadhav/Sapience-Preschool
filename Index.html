                    <p class="story-1 mt-4">Once there was a <strong>big warehouse</strong> full of rice bags.  Many rats lived there and ruined the grains. The owner was tired of finding ways to keep the rats away. So, he bought a cat and left it in the warehouse. <br> <br>

                         The cat would silently play around and chased the rats away. The rats were terrified and decided to have a meeting. They gathered together one evening at a <em class="text-warning">secluded</em> place and started their discussion. They were very confused and couldn’t think of any solution to stop the cat. <img class="bellthecat" src="Images/bellthecat.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>
                         
                         
                         Suddenly one of the rats said, ” We should tie a bell around the cat’s neck. If we tie a bell around the cat’s neck, we can hear the sound of the bell when the cat comes. This way we would be <strong class="text-danger">alerted</strong>.”  <br> <br>
                         
                         
                         
                         The rats found the idea <strong class="text-info">interesting</strong>. Then a rat asked, “who will tie the bell around the cat’s neck?” Now, all the rats fell silent as no one was willing to take a <strong class="text-danger">risk</strong>. They understood that it is easier said than done. <br> <br>

                    <p class="story-1 mt-4">A <strong>lion</strong> was once sleeping in his den when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun. This woke up the lion , and he was quite <strong class="text-danger">angry</strong>. <img class="lionmouse" src="Images/lion and mouse.jpg" alt=""> <br> <br>

                         He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse pleaded with the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion <strong class="text-warning">laughed</strong> at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.  <br> <br>
                         
                         One day, a few <strong class="text-success">hunters</strong> came into the forest and trapped the lion in a net. They tied him up against a tree. The lion started to roar and struggled to free himself. <br> <br>
                         
                         Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in <strong class="text-danger">trouble</strong>. He ran and called his friends for help. Together they gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. They ran off into the jungle and remain friends thereafter. <br> <br>

                    <h1 class="text-dark card-title d-flex justify-content-center">The Fox and the Crane</h1>
                    <p class="story-1 mt-4">One day, <strong>a wicked fox</strong> invited a crane for dinner. The crane was very <strong class="text-info">happy</strong> with the invitation. She reached the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door with her long beak.  She has been excited the whole day and was extremely hungry. <br> <br>

                         The fox soon served some soup in shallow bowls for both of them. The crane was surprised and <strong class="text-danger">angry</strong> too, as she couldn’t have soup at all. Her long beak couldn’t help her drink from the bowl. <br> <br>
                         
                         But, the fox licked up his soup quickly. Feeling cheated and humiliated, she decided to teach the fox a lesson soon. <br> <br>
                         
                         She didn’t show her anger and behaved politely with the fox. Before leaving she invited him for dinner the next day. She made rice porridge for the dinner and served it in two tall narrow vases. <img class="foxcrane" src="Images/foxnandcrane.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
                         
                         She happily drank her porridge from the vase. The fox tried hard but couldn’t, as the neck of the vessel was narrow.  The fox understood everything. He had learned his lesson and had to go home hungry. <br> <br>
